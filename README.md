This creates a form to use to bulk enter products into QuickBooks using name, color, description, and price.

To use, first populate the QBEntry.xlsx file with the requisite information (style names, colors, descriptions, prices, and sizes). Make sure to start with style names as this will populate all other sheets.

After running the program, a file called "Excel File for Quickbooks Entry.xlsx" is created which can be used for bulk entry in QuickBooks.
